# Currency-Calculator-Post-Holiday
A Python program that converts leftover foreign currency into USD using fixed exchange rates. Created to practice user input, arithmetic operations, and combining multiple data points.

PURPOSE

- This project was built as a beginner exercise to simulate a real-world scenario: converting leftover money from a holiday. It helped practice user input handling, arithmetic operations, and presenting results in a clear way.

HOW TO RUN 

- Install Python on your system.
- Download and run the file inside your terminal.
- Follow the on-screen prompts.
- The program will calculate your total in USD.

CONCEPTS PRACTICED

- Variables and data types
- User input handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Combining multiple values
- Conditional logic

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
- Fetch live exchange rates via an API.
- A dictionary could store names and exchange rates.
